# MyProject
This repository showcases my journey through various coding practices and freelance projects, demonstrating my skills in data analysis and real-world problem-solving. There are 2 sections 
### DataCamp Projects
- This section contains projects I completed on DataCamp. These projects tackle real-world problems and include various datasets.
### Freelance Data collection Projects
- This section showcases the work I've done as a freelancer since April 2024, focusing on cryptocurrency data collection and processing.
  The projects involve fetching candlestick data, tickers, and trade data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. The data is then cleaned, transformed, and structured into ready-to-use formats. I've honed my abilities in API integration, data extraction, data cleaning, and data transformation.
